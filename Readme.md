## Scroll Animation

To add scroll animation to your website, you can use various libraries and frameworks such as GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Owl Carousel.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing scroll animation using GSAP and Owl Carousel:

1. Install GSAP by including the following CDN link in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.9.1/gsap.min.js"></script>
```

2. Install Owl Carousel by including the following CDN link in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.3.4/assets/owl.carousel.min.css">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.3.4/owl.carousel.min.js"></script>
```

3. Create a new JavaScript file and link it to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/your/script.js"></script>
```

4. In your JavaScript file, initialize GSAP and create a new timeline:

```javascript
var tl = gsap.timeline();
```

5. Define your scroll animation using GSAP and Owl Carousel:

```javascript
tl.from('.your-element', { opacity: 0, y: 100, duration: 1 })
  .to('.owl-carousel', { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 1 }, '-=0.5');
```

6. Replace `.your-element` with the class or ID of the element you want to animate.

7. Replace `.owl-carousel` with the class or ID of the Owl Carousel element.

8. Customize the animation properties and duration according to your needs.

9. Save your changes and open your HTML file in a web browser to see the scroll animation in action.
